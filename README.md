# Job Data Analysis and Salary Prediction

I have cleaned and prepared for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted thorough EDA to uncover patterns and insights from the data.

Technical Highlights:
-Machine Learning Models: Implemented Random Forest and XGBoost models, with XGBoost providing superior performance.
-Metrics: Evaluated models using MAE and R2 score.
-Web Application: Developed a two-page website using Flask for real-time salary prediction and data exploration.
-User Experience: The prediction page allows users to input job details and receive salary estimates, while the explore page showcases insightful charts and graphs from the EDA.

Tech Stack:
-Programming Languages: Python
-Frameworks and Libraries: Flask, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
-Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda, Spyder
-Deployment: Model pickled for efficient prediction via Flask API
